# Ideology

## Introduction - Tradition & Modernity

Our vision is to create a society that is not divided by self-identified communities but is united by a shared sense of purpose. We believe that by establishing a genuine social structure that is based on mutual support, shared values, and a dogmatic dedication to a new way of life, we can achieve this vision. This requires a commitment from all members of our community to work together, to support each other, and to uphold the values that define us. We recognize that this will not be easy, but we are determined to make it a reality. We are constantly exploring new ways to strengthen our community and ensure that it remains a vibrant and welcoming place for all who share our vision.

### Introduction: Brief outline of themes

Our current society is oppressive and unfulfilling, with many individuals feeling disillusioned and disconnected from their communities. We believe that the only solution to this problem is to build something new, something that takes into account the failures and shortcomings of our current social systems while also promoting positive change and progress. We don't just want to avoid the problems of the past; we want to actively push for a more interesting and fulfilling way of life based on the following key concepts:

1. Eliminating boredom
2. Embracing dogmatism without apology
3. Cultivating tribalism to promote individual freedom while inspiring proper interpersonal conduct
4. Emphasizing real-life conversations and experiences 
5. Guiding the lost towards a social reality curated to counter numbness
6. Prioritizing execution and results
7. Meeting fundamental human needs

### Psychology of Modern Online Community

Influencers and the Influenced

Individuals who are attracted to online communities often have a desire to achieve success, fueled by stories of people who have become millionaires overnight and the possibility of a financial utopia. However, more often than not, this leads to toxic positivity, oversimplification of complex realities, and followers being led into risky behavior.

Early adopters and charismatic figures shape discourse and set trends, giving them more control over behaviors, values, and identities. Unfortunately, this can result in misguided worship of online individuals and their personas.

In a culture that promotes conformity, a desire for uniqueness often results in a lack of genuine drive and willpower.

### Antisocial Impacts of Online Society

Intermittent rewards systems - vulnerability to addictive behavior

Transactional social relationships causing loneliness and isolation. Commoditization of the individual.

Social media platforms offer captivating stories and rewards such as potential wealth, entertaining content, and improved wellbeing that keep users engaged. However, these platforms also exploit human vulnerability to addictive behaviors, contributing to increased screen time and mental health concerns. The constant supply of information and the never-ending push for engagement can lead to information overload, reduced productivity, and elevated stress levels.

### The Threat of all of This

Colonization of the mind by bad actors.

As more of our time is claimed by digital platforms, we have less time for productive, real-world activities. This can have a negative impact on our work performance, academic achievement, and personal growth.

Diminishes our patience for slow, thoughtful consumption of information in favor of reactionary, impulsive and irrational consumption and decision making.

Living under perpetual scrutiny can heighten social pressure and encourage comparison, both of which can negatively impact mental health.

Ideas can be handicapped by their reliance on umbrella networks. Modern online communities often fail to give new ideas the opportunity to flourish and break away from insular online networks and isolated social circles.

### What is Lost

deep, sustained attention

loss of human experience

richness of face-to-face interaction

erosion of the boundary between interior world and exterior presentation

reducing the diversity and depth of human thought

### The Near Future

erosion of trust in online content causing 

Condemnation of good actors (usually in favor of stable group dynamics at scale)

Allowing bad actors to take advantage of communities as long as they don’t rock the boat.

Extractive behavior and grifting enabled by large scale online networks lacking vetting processes and rewarding anything that appears to be part of these networks at first glance.

Dissolution of the individual for the sake of productivity and/or to prevent friction.

### Strategy

We envision a community where people unite to fight against oppression and build a better future. By committing ourselves to this new way of life, we can create something truly special.

The Convent, arts and music, technology, soul incubation, etc etc (see below)

shared experience, mutual bonds, experiential learning

education & literacy

prioritizing well-being over engagement

reclamation of public space

fostering understanding that transcends the superficial ‘knowledge’ often gleaned from brief online content

Public spaces are critical, as these places serve as arenas for face-to-face interactions and shared experiences, fostering a sense of community and belonging. These spaces can serve as anchors in our rapidly changing world, grounding us in the physical reality of our existence.

### Conclusion w/ Call To Action

Our goal is to create a dynamic and meaningful physical space that goes beyond being a mere venue for conferences and networking. Our aim is to establish a sacred place where people can live, work, strategize and rely together.  earnestly to build a better future. We understand that this is a challenging task, but we are fully committed to making it happen because we believe that there is no alternative.
